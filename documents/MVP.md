## Data analysis and NLP

I have filtered rows from the original dataset and converted it into
a dataframe. Then I proceeded natural language processing and converted
words into a vector. The files for data analysis and NLP are [here](/data_processing).

## Baseline model

I did topic modeling using LSA and clustered them into 5 clusters using
K-means. The algorithm and virtualizations are shown [here](/model/baseline.ipynb).
